# ðŸš— Vehicle Speed Detection using YOLO and Python

This project uses **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection and computer vision techniques to detect vehicles in real-time and estimate their **speed** from video footage or live camera streams.

By combining **YOLOâ€™s fast object detection** with **frame-by-frame tracking and distance estimation**, the system can accurately estimate the speed of each vehicle in a scene.
